# My Projects

Here are some of my data science projects:

# [Heart Rate](https://github.com/fahimhoq96/Effects-on-Max-Heart-Rate-by-Blood-Pressure-Cholesterol)

![](/images/hearts-unsplash.jpg) 

Cleveland dataset of 303 people was used to see if maximum heart rate is an association with resting blood pressure and if maximum heart rate has an association with serum cholesterol. Two different linear regression models was used to answer these questions. The dataset was downloaded from kaggle. The data was collected by Robert Detrano, M.D., Ph.D of the Cleveland Clinic Foundation. The dataset has 14 variables. The response variable analyzed in this paper is the Maximum heart rate achieved. Sample size in the dataset is 303. Covariates of interest are Blood Pressure and Cholesterol. Other variables such as gender, age of patients, blood sugar, chest pain etc. were used as confounding and precision variables in the modeling. R was used for this project.

# [Paper Helicopter](https://github.com/fahimhoq96/The-Paper-Helicopter-Project)
The objective of the experiment is to find out the optimal design of a paper helicopter given the restriction of paper size (21cm x 28cm). The objective required the exploration of the best combination from the nine distinct selected design factors, which would assist the paper helicopter in staying for longest time in the air, given the paper size.

There was a initial screening experiment to determine the key variables, then using those variables we performed steepest ascent and central composite design experiment. This was followed by response surface plots, contour plots and its canonical analysis to identify the optimal design. Finally, confirmation run was done to test the hypothesis whether our model of paper helicopter was indeed the optimal design.

# [Technical Analysis on Ethereum](https://github.com/fahimhoq96/Technical-Analysis-on-Ethereum)

Data set includes the price of Ethereum for the year 2022. I have done analysis of Simple Moving Average, Exponential Moving Average and Relative Strength Index using Python.

# [Tableau Viz](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/fahim.hoq)
I have made 2 Viz from the same data. The data is from a survey. The Survey was made by Alex Freberg by using social media. The data set was downloaded from Alex Freberg's Github page. There were a total of 630 participants.

[1st Viz:](https://public.tableau.com/views/SurveyofDataJobs/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link) Comparing Work-Life Balance between Data Jobs. Respondants were asked to rate their Work-Life balance on a scale of 1 to 10.

[2nd Viz:](https://public.tableau.com/views/PopularityofprogrammingLanguages/PopularityofVariousProgrammingLanguages?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link) Answering which is the favorite prommramming language among people interested in Data Science.

# [Data Cleaning](https://github.com/fahimhoq96/DataCleaning)

![](/images/clean.jpg)

Software used: Microsoft SQL server

# [Ice Cream Cone](https://github.com/fahimhoq96/IceCreamCone)

![](/images/Ice.jpg)

Finding best model using Regression analysis in R. Flour is used in baking ice cream cones. The flour content contains ash, moisture, protein etc. My objective was to find a model that best describes the relationship between the response variable viscosity with the explanatory variables: moisture, protein, and ash.
